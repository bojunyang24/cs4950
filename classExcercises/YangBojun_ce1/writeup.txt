If you use a custom UGen (Unit Generator) for your exercise, describe it below:

I chose a High Pass Filter for the additional UGen and the UI slider has a range of 0.0 to 21150.0 with a starting value of 200.0. 
I chose this this filter because the low pass filter was not affecting my track in a very significant way so I tried using a high pass filter and increased the range.
The filter is very noticeable around 2300.00
