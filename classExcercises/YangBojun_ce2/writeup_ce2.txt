1. I recorded my background sound in the courtyard of my apartment building. It was during when my friends and I were having a cookout and I told everyone I needed 20 seconds to record sounds. There was background music from our speakers and my friends made some noises during the recording. 
2. My source for the voiceover was a funny picture found online after a google search of a kid's drawing of her mom selling shovels at home depot. The drawing was misinterpreted to be the mom dancing on a pole which was just a badly drawn shovel. My roommate read this.
