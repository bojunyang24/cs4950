If you use a custom UGen (Unit Generator) for your exercise, describe it below:


The extra UGen was a Reverb. The way you can control affect its sound is through controlling its early reverb level.

I made the decrease of brightness of the beat visualizer slower so the screen wasn't flashing on and off rapidly.
