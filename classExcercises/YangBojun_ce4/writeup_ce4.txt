I designed this assignment like a cassette player. I have a play, stop, fast forward, rewind, and reset button. 
Each button, when pressed, gives an auditory confirmation that the button has been pressed. It's someone saying what the button does. 
The piano sound file I got from freesounds at https://freesound.org/people/TheWorkingBamboo/sounds/257738/
As an extra feature to test the endListener, I added a glide that can be used to set the position of the track by sliding it. It also prints out what time the glide is set to in milliseconds. 
This glide plays sound when the track is playing but doesn't play sound when the track is not playing.
